# Path Daddy
Tool that helps you manipulate SVG paths. ✨[brainly.github.io/path-daddy](https://brainly.github.io/path-daddy/)✨

## Why?

SVGs created in Sketch or Illustrator usually need optimiation. We love [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) (and [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)!), but it won't do all the optimizations for you.

Cleaning up SVGs manually is fun, but manipulating complex paths by hand is almost impossible. Ergo Path Daddy.

## How?

Right now Path Daddy is essentially an UI for the fantastic [svgpath](https://github.com/fontello/svgpath) project, but we have [plans to go beyond that](https://github.com/brainly/path-daddy/issues).

It's also our first Vue.js project ❤️
